# cpp_examples
C++ Reference and Examples

This is a GitHub Repo designed to serve as a set of reference examples that
demonstrate how to do the basics as well as how to use the more modern 
features of C++ and provide reference implementations of design patterns.

This is a work in progress. Pull/merge requests will be considered on a
case-by-case basis, particuarly those improving commentary and adding examples,
when the repo is more mature.
